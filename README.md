# moderngl-template-git-submodule

Template project for C++ OpenGL applications. This project is built with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). A [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)-loader has been generated and downloaded separately, and [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) is included in the build although it is not used in the sample code.

The sample code (in `main.cc`) is essentially the "hello triangle" example from [learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com).

## Quickstart

A makefile has been added for convenience - to see the direct commands please refer to this.

``` sh
$ make
$ ./build/moderngl-template-git-submodule
```

## Contributing
