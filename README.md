# moderngl-template

Template project for C++ OpenGL applications. This project is built with CMake and uses git submodules. GLAD has, however, been downloaded separately, and GLM is included in the build albeit is not used in the sample code.

The sample code (in `main.cc`) is the "hello triangle" example from learnopengl.com.

## Quickstart

``` sh
$ make
$ ./build/moderngl-template-git-submodule
```
